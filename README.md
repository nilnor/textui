# TextUI - a module for easily creating text based interfaces for Textadept

## What is it?

TextUI is a module for the [Textadept Editor](http://code.google.com/p/textadept/)
that allows you to easily create custom text based interfaces. It enables you to
create text based interfaces using custom, non-lexer based, styling, and offers
an easy way of responding to user input.

## Installation

You can download TextUI from the [download page](https://github.com/nilnor/textui/downloads).
Install it by unpacking the contents to the `~/.textadept/modules/textui/` directory.

If you so desire you can of course also clone the repository using git into the
same directory.

## Usage

To get started with development using TextUI, head over to the
[LDoc documentation](http://nilnor.github.com/textui/docs). A good place to start is
the documentation for the
[textui module](http://nilnor.github.com/textui/docs/modules/_M.textui.html) itself.

[LICENSE](https://github.com/nilnor/textui/blob/master/LICENSE) for the full license.

If you want to provide patches, the preferred way of doing so would be as a pull
